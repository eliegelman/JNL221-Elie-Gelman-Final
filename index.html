   <p><strong> A System Transformed by the Pandemic</strong></p>

   <p> New York City’s transit system is still struggling to regain its pre-COVID-19 rhythm. The pandemic’s impact on New York’s transit system was immediate and dramatic. Ridership dropped as offices closed, tourism dried up, and New Yorkers stayed home.Today, even as Broadway shows sell out and bridge and tunnel traffic returns to normal, subway and commuter rail ridership remain below 2019 levels. While the city has largely reopened, the numbers show that it has not made a full return to pre-pandemic transit habits. The data and expertise from transit officials and advocates reveal both the challenges and the slow progress of this recovery. </p>

   <p><strong> Remote Work: The Game Changer</strong></p>

   <p>The most significant factor holding back transit’s recovery is remote and hybrid work. According to David Greenberger, a manager in MTA Construction Development, the shift to working from home is “a lot more common now than it had been pre-2020,” with the biggest impact on rush hour travel. “Rush-hour ridership has been kind of the slowest to recover,” he explained, noting that off-peak and weekend travel have rebounded better. This trend is even stronger for commuter railroads like LIRR and Metro-North, which are designed for workers traveling into Manhattan from outside the city.  </p>

   <p> Transit advocate and Executive Director at the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled Joe Rappaport agrees, emphasizing that many companies have downsized or eliminated offices, making daily commutes unnecessary for a large section of the workforce. “Should you spend an hour commuting to work if you could roll out of bed and sit at your desk at home? Many people would prefer to be at home. It gives them some flexibility,” Rappaport explained. For people with disabilities, remote work has been especially important, opening up job opportunities that were previously inaccessible due to the city’s challenging transit system.

<p><strong> Crime and Public Safety</strong></p>

<p> Concerns about safety on public transit have also received significant attention. The rate of felony assaults in the subway system hit a <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-economy-rebounded-from-covid-19-the-subways-not-so-much/"> 27-year high in 2023,</a> though NYPD data shows major crime rates are now trending lower. Greenberger believes that while crime and the perception of danger may influence some riders, these concerns are not the primary reason for the slow recovery. “If the subway was the best way to get there in 2019, it’s probably still the best way to get there in 2025,” he said, suggesting that the effect is likely marginal.

<p><strong> Congestion Pricing: A New Incentive</strong></p>

<p>The introduction of congestion pricing in January 2025 has already begun to change travel patterns. Traffic into Manhattan’s Central Business District dropped by up to 11%, with three million fewer vehicles entering the area between January and February compared to the <a href="https://futuretransport-news.com/public-transport-ridership-up-traffic-down-mta-offers-update-on-nycs-crz/"> previous year.</a> At the same time, transit ridership has seen a significant bump: bus ridership increased by 9%, subway ridership by 6%, and commuter railroads by up to 8% since the <a href="https://futuretransport-news.com/public-transport-ridership-up-traffic-down-mta-offers-update-on-nycs-crz/">
new policy began.</a> Faster bus service and reduced congestion are making public transit more attractive, while funds from congestion pricing promise long-term investments in system improvements. </p>

<p> Greenberger sees congestion pricing as a critical part of the city's transit’s future: “I do expect that with congestion pricing, which is still only a few months old… that will certainly accelerate and already has accelerated-transit ridership growth across all modes, both by reducing the attractiveness of driving in the short term and making bus service faster on many lines. That makes bus service more attractive. And in the longer run, as funds from congestion pricing make their way toward new capital projects, I hope it attracts more people back to the system or initially to the system.”</p>



<p><strong> Metro-North’s Strongest Year Since COVID</strong></p>

<p> Despite the overall lag in recovery, there are bright spots. Metro-North Railroad saw a 12.1% increase in ridership from 2023 to 2024, recording its highest monthly ridership since the pandemic in  <a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/icymi-governor-hochul-announces-2024-metro-norths-railroads-strongest-year-yet-record"> October 2024. </a>  Average weekday ridership in November 2024 reached 81.4% of pre-COVID levels, while weekend ridership soared to 94.2% of pre-pandemic  <a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/icymi-governor-hochul-announces-2024-metro-norths-railroads-strongest-year-yet-record"> numbers. </a>

<p><strong> Looking Ahead</strong></p>

<p>Projections for a quick return to pre-pandemic ridership have proven overly optimistic. The MTA’s own <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-economy-rebounded-from-covid-19-the-subways-not-so-much/">
consultant report </a> from 2022 predicted that if office workers returned only two days a week, overall ridership would stall. The future of New York’s transit system will depend on how work habits, urban life, and policy continuing to evolve.</p>

<p>New York City’s transit system today is a reminder of how deeply the pandemic has reshaped daily life. Subways, buses, and commuter rails remain essential, but their ridership reflects a new reality-one shaped by hybrid work, changing travel patterns, and the slow but steady return to pre-COVID life. As the city invests in its transit future and adjusts to new policies, the hope is that more New Yorkers will once again find their way back onto trains and buses. </p>
